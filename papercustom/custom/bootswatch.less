// Ideally the only thing in this fille will be the import of the default
// paper bootswatch styles. Any overrides of those styles would be in a file
// matching the bootstrap file structure.
// If there are new styles defined by bootswatch (rather than just changes to
// bootstrap), then they could be changed here.

// Import default paper styles.
